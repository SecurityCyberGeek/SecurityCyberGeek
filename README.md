## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**SecurityCyberGeek/SecurityCyberGeek** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a capstone project for my Master of Advanced Studies in Data Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. It's called "Using LLMs to Improve Student Outcomes" and this project is to find out if students do better with an AI tutor or via traditional instruction. My group's part is helping our faculty advisor, Dr. Sesh Murthy, to implement this project into UC San Diego and then possibly to other colleges and high schools.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science, machine learning, and Python programming.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with gaining full time employment as a Security Analyst, Security Engineer, or Data Scientist.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cyber security, Capture the Flag (CTF) events, etc.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tiharmon@ucsd.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Cisco Insider Champion, have my own blog site (www.securitycybergeek.com), a Cisco Networking Academy Student Advisory Board member, and a Core Planning Member for BSides San Diego (www.bsidessd.org) - Volunteer Coordinator 2022 & 2024 and Graphic Designer 2025 - Present.
